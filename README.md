# Portfolio

## Description

This project is a presentation of my work. The objective of this project is to showcase the work I've done and demonstrate my understanding of HTML and CSS. In the building of this projects I made sure that the page meets accessibility standards as well as added properties to ensure that the page would be responsive to the users screensize. I intend to add more features as my knowledge grows to better display my skills to potential clients/employers.

## Features

- Webpage responsiveness using media query.
- Interactivity using pseudo elements.
- Clean/ minimalistic design using flexbox.
- Added links that redirect based on their design function.

## Usage

The website was deployed through github and can be accessed via the provided link below. The media is scalable for smaller screens. There is a media query set specically for media width of 375px and will be updated for more queries in the future.
